Before we start, you need to open PSQL Terminal and create a DB,
You can achieve it with this command

```
CREATE DATABASE manager;
```

The server runs on 8080 port (By default), but if you have any conflicts, you can change it here too.
Username and password for the DB you can configure while creating database.

```
#application.properties
server.port = 8080

jdbc.driverClassName=org.postgresql.Driver
jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/manager
jdbc.username=postgres
jdbc.password=421970
hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
hibernate.show_sql=false
hibernate.format_sql=true
hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=create
```

@SpringBootApplication
public class ManagerApplication {
    //...
}
